### A full-stack Python framework for creating interactive web applications from Jupyter Notebooks.

Experiments for serving Jupyter Notebook files through Tornado websockets as an interactive web application.

---

# How it works ü§∑üèΩ
#### ~ Streamlit + Jupyter Notebook:

- The client connects through websocket
- The server reads and compiles the Notebook's source code and executes it cell by cell
- The Notebook calls widgets
- The widgets send their states to the client through the server
- The client displays the widgets as UI components
- The client sends the input to the server on user interactions
- The server partially re-executes the Notebook with the new input

+1 Works embedded inside Jupyter without running a server
